## About the Collection

This collection of digitzed photographs belonged to my mother, Tammy Wells and were taken on her class trip to Spain in 1978. 
Although my mother passed in 2011, I wanted to share her photos in honor of her memory. This was a project for the University of Iowa's Inforamtion and Organization course.
