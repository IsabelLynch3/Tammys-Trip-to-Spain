## About the Collection

This collection is my mother's digitized photos from various locations in Spain in 1978, and although my mother passed in 2011 I wanted to share her photos. This was a project for the University of Iowa's Inforamtion and Organization course. 

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents
